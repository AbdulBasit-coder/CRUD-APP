Simple Laravel application for assessment

1. Clone the repository "https://github.com/AbdulBasit-coder/CRUD-APP.git"
2. Run composer install/update to get vendor available on project root directory
3. Run npm install to get node_modules on project root directory
4. Run npm install vue-excel-export ( Due to less time I have used this package to download CSV)
5. Run php artisan migrate ( this will add the database schema to the database DATABASE NAME : products)

Application URL : http://127.0.0.1:8000/product

About the application: 

This laravel application will perform simple CRUD operations with product model.
1. Product listing is rendered with VUE JS and using axios to get product listing.
2. loading indicated the data is being fetched once fetched it will render dataset.
3. Create product page is completed with bootstrap.
4. Edit page is completed with bootstrap.
5. I have used Resource controller name : ProductController and model name: Product with migration
6. Did attempted unit test but was not able to pull that off as I have never created one but have knowledge about how to create one. I did generated the test unit but did not worked on it.
7. I have lots of experience using React and Vue components with laravel and have experience with Filteration on real time rendered data.
8. I have used VUE JS but I can work with React JS both (functional & class Component).
9. I have never used queueing mechanism with csv but I have worked with event and jobs creation with laravel.

Important to know that this application I have created is in very limited time and the purpose of touching each point is that I know the working but due to office hours, I only had 3 hours to do this application.

Hope this works.

Thanks,
